Here are several mindsets that I have found useful for learning: 1. If you can, get an editable text so that you can write notes between the paragraphs, summarize each paragraph with the attitude of “How do I apply this information?” 2. Some information isn’t amenable to “applying,” so ask yourself, “How would I teach this information?” Pretend that you are the teacher. That shift in perspective is very helpful in learning. 3. If you are overwhelmed by a subject, that is a red flag for you. Figure out a way to simplify the material. This may require another book that is written at a simpler level. 4. If you are in college, go to office hours. Talk with your teacher about the subject. (Notice that in doing this, you are “applying” the material.) Get your teacher to talk about their research. That is also learning how the material you are studying is applied. 5. Memorize formulas—and ponder what they are telling you. They are like shorthand for important concepts. 6. To learn geography, draw what you are trying to learn until you can do it from memory. (This is “application” again.) 7. Watch out for “open book” tests. Prepare for those as if your text is a mile away. Looking up a topic during a test will waste time. 8. For pure memory, find some books on the “locus technique.” (Each room in your house contains the numbers 1-10. The corners are odd numbers, the middle of the wall is the next even number. The floor is 9, and the ceiling is 10. Start with the same corner of each room for 1, 11, 21, 31.... Be able to walk through your house counting off the locations. Now put pictures there. For the presidents of the U.S., imagine a washing machine at position 1 (Washington), a toilet with atoms bubbling out of it at position 2 (John Adams), The son of someone you know named Jeff doing something at position 3 (Jefferson). You get the idea.)
