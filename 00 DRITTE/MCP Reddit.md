# The Uncomfortable Truth About MCP

Most of the "amazing" MCP demos you see are:

1. Cherry-picked examples
    
2. One-off use cases
    
3. Cool but not practical for daily work
    

**The real value** is in having 2-4 really solid servers that solve actual problems you have every day.

# What I'd Tell My Past Self

# Start Small

Pick one problem you have daily. Find or build an MCP for that. Use it for a week. Then maybe add one more.

# Read-Only First

Never give an MCP write access until you've used it read-only for at least a month. I learned this the hard way when Claude "helpfully" updated a production config file.

# Profile Everything

Token usage, response times, actual utility. Half my original MCPs were net-negative on productivity once I measured properly.

# Optimize for Your Workflow

Don't use an MCP because it's cool. Use it because it solves a problem you actually have.

# The MCPs I Removed and Why

# Weather MCP

Cool demo, zero practical value. When do I need Claude to tell me the weather?

# File System MCP

Security nightmare. Also, I can just... use the terminal?

# Calendar MCP

Turns out I don't want Claude scheduling meetings for me. Too risky.

# AWS MCP

Read-only monitoring was useful, but I realized I was just recreating CloudWatch in Claude. Pointless.

# Slack MCP

Added 3-second delays to every message operation. Slack's UI is already fast enough.

# My Monthly MCP Costs (Reality Check)

**Before optimization:**

- Claude API: $120/month
    
- Time spent managing MCPs: ~8 hours/month
    
- Productivity gain: Questionable
    

**After optimization:**

- Claude API: $45/month
    
- Time spent managing MCPs: ~1 hour/month
    
- Productivity gain: Actually measurable
    

**The lesson:** More isn't better. Better is better.
