You can change the settings folder in Obsidian under: "Files & Links" > "Override config folder".

I used to use Syncthing, and by setting up different configuration folders for each device, such as ".obsidian_android" and ".obsidian_chromebook", I didn't encounter any specific issues.

However, keep in mind that when you modify Obsidian settings, CSS snippets, or plugin settings, you will need to manually adjust these settings on each device individually.
